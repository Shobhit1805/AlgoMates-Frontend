# 🚀 AlgoMates – Frontend

AlgoMates is a developer-focused connection platform inspired by modern social matching experiences.  
It blends a discovery-based UI with meaningful networking — helping developers connect, collaborate, and grow together.

This repository contains the **frontend client** of the AlgoMates web application.  
All business logic, authentication, data validation, and core operations are handled by the backend API.

## 🌟 Overview

AlgoMates is not purely a dating platform and not strictly a professional network.  
It’s a hybrid experience designed for:

- 👨‍💻 Developers looking to connect  
- 🤝 Collaboration & project building  
- 💬 Real-time chat interactions  
- ⭐ Premium feature access  

The frontend communicates with a dedicated backend server for:

- User authentication & JWT handling  
- Feed generation  
- Connection request management  
- Chat message storage  
- Premium membership verification  
- Payment processing
